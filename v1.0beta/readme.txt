This is a script for an ArcGIS tool to calculate an index of influence intensity (e.g., hunting) from multiple features (e.g., villages, expressed as points, lines or polygons) using a cost surface (e.g., travel time). The features can be weighted (e.g., by population size), and the result is expressed in weight (e.g. hunter population) and can be converted to integer.

This folder and subfolders contain data for ArcGIS geoprocessing tools. For simple help, start ArcCatalog, right-click the toolbox, then click Help. For a complete description of the tool, see the pdf in this folder.
